              I am a developer seeking opportunities in Web Development, with experience in Full Stack Development programming and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). I am passionate about learning new technologies that allow me to build interesting things. After several years of professional work in GIS, I began teaching myself web development as my work necessitated it before I finally jumped headfirst into a coding bootcamp. I live for the thrill of applying new skills to conjure solutions to the problems I’m trying to solve. I always feel like a wizard when I hit that “a-ha!” moment and everything clicks. When I’m not knees-deep in console log errors, I also enjoy building fun things in VR using.

          The idea behind this app is a virtual assistant that can respond to

          commands and Apple's Siri. We have integrated several libraries that gives our 
          virtual assistant the power to server dyanmic content.

          This project was made with Python as the backend and Django as the framework. It 
          is hosted on an AWS Ec2 instance of Ubuntu 16 and is run with Nginix. The content 
          that is returned is the reuslt of several different API that that application 
          queries with commands from the user.

          <p>
            This project was made in a group at the conclusion of the MEAN stack for Coding Dojo.
            The goal of this project is to adapt the popular board game “Exploding Kittens” 
            into a playable web application. We want players to be able to invite friends and play 
            with them. We chose to build this application using socket.io to allow for instant interaction between players.
            The front end is Javascript and the backend is Node and Socket.io. Every interaction with the game board is sent 
            back to a server and emitted out to every other player.
          </p>
          <p>
            The challange with this project was that the socket listeners and emitters were all on the same file. In hindsight we should have modularized this out.
            This made using this project with git very difficult since all members of the group were editing the same two files. We learned how important 
            bieng able to modularize your code out when working in groups.

          <p>
            Below are some of the ways I visualize data that is collected.
            The survey managers often ask about the progress of the field
            operation on a district by district basis. I aggregate the
            data by district, and answer is how many of each case status
            each district has collected. Survey Managers ask
            how many of each case status field staff have resolved.
            This important to visualize because it shows at a
            glance who has the most completes, or who has the most incomplete.
            Using <a class="link" href="http://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/">Chart.js
            </a> I am able to make graphs and charts dynamically

                <li>Takes the county code from the attributes of the selected county</li>
                <li>Adds in the appropriate Tiger road shapefile using the
                  identified county code from the previous step</li>
                <li>It names the layer in the table of contents, labels the
                  Tiger roads by road name, and symbolizses the roads.</li>
                <li>Lastly it adds a basemap for spatial reference</li>
              </ol>
              <p class="nonlistworkflow">
                The plugin streamlines several steps, it adds in the data
                and zooms to the location with the push of a button. When
                the tool is given a new pair of coordinates, it removes the
                tiger roads from the previous use to reduce clutter. It also
                takes the coordinate data in its natural order Lat/Long, rather
                than having to flip the order so that QGIS can zoom to it.
                This tool allowed me a more effecient workflow.</p>

            Reactjs</a> framework my group developed this application. By clicking through the buttons, users can filter the drink

            <a class="link" href="https://addb.absolutdrinks.com/docs/">ABSOLUT API</a>. The JSON returned from the API once 
            called was manipulated with features from the new ES6 features. The scafolding of the website was created using the 
            <a class="link" href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app">create-react-app</a> 
            tool. I hope you give the site a visit at <a class="link" href="https://mixologylab.io/">mixology.io</a>
